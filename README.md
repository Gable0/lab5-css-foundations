## Reflections
Fun project, I liked that it felt like I was actually making something. I liked that I had to look up how to do things and then was able to apply that knowledge later in the project and didn't need to look it up again. I now have a better understanding of what is happening behind the glass then I am using a webpage.

### What Went Well
- Organization: I tried to keep related items together as best I could
- Separation: As per the instructions, keeping my HTML and CSS in separate files helps so I know were one ends and the other begins
- Details: I added extra things such as the gradient to make the page not only look closer to the reference, but also to make it look more polished

### Challenges Faced
- W3C Validator: Having to go back and change things that I didn't know were a problem was annoying. 
- Spacing: Figuring out where/how to arrange the blocks and sections was challenging. One moment its fine, then one rem unit change later and a button is off in Narnia
